        Play with Dependency Injection using SubCut
    </h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" target="_blank">Dependency injection</a> is a design
        pattern that frees your code from creational concerns, making your code cleaner and easier to test.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial illustrates how easy it is to use a dependency injection framework with Play.
        <a href="https://github.com/dickwall/subcut/blob/master/GettingStarted.md" target="_blank">SubCut</a>
        is used here. SubCut distinguishes itself by leveraging Scala's type system for dependency injection.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tutorial will take about 10 minutes to complete and assumes that you are already familiar with the basics
        of a Play application.

    <h2>
        The Mission
    </h2>

    <p>
        The mission is to use the familiar starting point of a Play application and enhance it with dependency
        injection. We will be taking the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">Application</a> class and injecting a a
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">TextGenerator</a> instance into it.
        TextGenerator is an abstract class and we have a concrete implementation of it in the form of
        <a href="#code/app/services/TextGenerator.scala" class="shortcut">WelcomeTextGenerator</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        TextGenerator is a rudimentary service that simply generates text. You'll have more useful
        services in your code e.g. a repository service that is backed by a concrete class to communicate with a
        database. By using dependency injection we can configure the type of service required outside of the class that
        needs to call on it.

        Conclusion
    </h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial has introduced how SubCut can be used for developing Play applications. The Global object
        establishes the dependency injection system and the routes file requires classes to be referenced via the '@' symbol.
    </p>

    <p>
        By separating the creational concerns from a class, classes can remain focused on the job they are intended to
        do and have their code remain clean and devoted to that purpose. In addition your classes will become more
        testable, particularly from a unit test perspective, given that injectable types can easily be mocked.
